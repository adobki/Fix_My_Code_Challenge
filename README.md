# Fix My Code Challenges
Contains various Fix-My-Code Challenges, which are optional source code debugging tasks from the ALX SE program.

**Fix-My-Code** is a new type of project, where weâ€™ll jump into an existing code base and fix it! The scope of these challenges is a focus on algorithms and general coding syntax, so some challenges include code from programming languages and features that students in the program might not have been familiar with at the time the projects/tasks were given. So we were asked not to recode everything, just fix it!
